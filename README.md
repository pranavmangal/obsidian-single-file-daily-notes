An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin for creating and managing daily notes in a single file.

## Features

### Create and manage daily notes

The plugin will create a new note for today automatically and select the dummy entry for immediate editing. If today's note already exists, it will try to position the cursor for appending/editing the existing note.

The result is a single standard Markdown file:

```md
#### 02-01-2024, Tuesday

-   entry

#### 01-01-2024, Monday

-   Started planning for Q1 goals
-   Cleaned up the store room, needed to make space for the new suitcase
-   Read a few more chapters of [[The Dark Forest]]
```

### Use a calendar view

This plugin has a built-in calendar view that is displayed in the sidebar. This can be used to quickly jump to the daily note for a chosen date, and create one if it does not exist.

This calendar view can be shown/hidden using the command palette (`⌘ + P`).

### See an outline view

Since daily notes are formed by using standard Markdown headings, Obsidian's built-in outline view can be used to browse through them.

### Configurability

You are able to configure:

-   The name for the daily notes file
-   The location of file
-   The type of headings used for daily notes
-   The date format used for daily notes

## Installation

The plugin is available on the [official community plugins list](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=single-file-daily-notes) maintained by Obsidian.

Otherwise, the plugin can be installed via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

## Usage

-   Disable Obsidian's built-in core daily notes plugin from settings.
    - This plugin does not yet interact with notes created by the core plugin, or any other community plugins designed to work with it.
    - While keeping it enabled will not affect either plugin, it may cause confusion.
-   Open this plugin's settings to configure it to your preferences
-   Click on the ribbon icon or select "Open daily notes" via the command palette (`⌘ + P`) to create the daily notes file.
-   Once created, the file can be opened like a regular file, via the ribbon icon or the command palette.
-   Start editing!

## Why

The in-built daily notes system in Obsidian is pretty decent, however it works by creating a separate file for each note. There are plugins to better manage these notes and display them in different views, but they still don't change the underlying file structure.

I didn't want hundreds of files in my vault dedicated to these daily notes, especially when they were quite small individually, which is why I created this plugin.

If you prefer writing longer and detailed daily notes, and wish to use the rest of Obsidian's plugin ecosystem that extends the built-in plugin, then this plugin might not be the best option for you.
